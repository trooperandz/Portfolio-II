# All html was built inside of a custom 'Bootstrap' look-alike grid, for purposes of familiarization.

# There are two different sets of files, with the following subject matter and contents:

1. Full-screen , fluid grid layout (responsive characteristics):
 * index.html
 * portfolio.html
 * contact.html
 * style.css


2. Fixed-width container grid layout with width == 960px, per original instructions:
 * index_fixed_container.html
 * portfolio_fixed_container.html
 * contact_fixed_container.html
 * style_fixed_width_960px.css

## Please note that the custom grid system in the exercise makes it impossible to stretch the main `<section>` and `<aside>` areas to the specifications in the original instructions when container width == 960px.
##Programmatically, the grid system is better for long-term maintenance and adaptability.
