# Portfolio - Assignment 1

> This assignment is designed to familiarize students with responsive web design, using a custom layout without Bootstrap's framework.

# This repository contains the following files:

 * index.html
 * index.php
 * portfolio.html
 * contact.html
 * style.css
 * composer.json

## Please note the following discrepancies from the original assignment instructions:

 * The medium-width screen @media instruction starts at 767px instead of the recommended 768px.  This is due to the dev tools medium-device inspector showing unstyled content when it is displaying the iPad simulator. A solution has yet to be found, but is in progress.

 * The site is formatted in a fluid-grid system, instead of the recommended max 980px container limit.  This is because I couldn't help myself.  I felt that the layout was much more appealing in this manner, and it is successfully executed with my custom grid layout (until further notice!!).
